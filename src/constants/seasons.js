        description: 'At the beginning of winter, fish remain quite active and bite throughout the day. The best time for fishing is early morning and late afternoon. In mid-winter, during the so-called “dead season,” fish activity decreases, and bites occur in short periods, mostly in the morning and late evening. At the end of winter, when the thaw begins, fish become more active again.'

        title: 'BEST SPOTS',
        description: 'In winter, fish gather in deep holes and near underwater ridges. Predators like pike and walleye stay near areas with sharp depth changes. Whitefish such as bream and roach prefer calmer waters with little current. On rivers, the best spots are areas with slowed currents, while in lakes, the transition zones between deep and shallow areas are ideal.'

        title: 'GEAR AND BAIT',
        description: 'Winter fishing requires specialized equipment: short ice fishing rods, jigs with live bait like maggots or bloodworms, and balancers for predatory fish. Choosing the right bait is crucial – in cold water, fish eat less, so the bait should be light yet attractive (crumbled breadcrumbs, dry milk, anise oil).'

        description: 'In winter, the sea offers opportunities to catch cod, flounder, hake, and haddock. The best methods include jigging, bottom fishing, and ice trolling in some regions. The sea in winter is unpredictable, so anglers must consider weather conditions and follow safety measures.'

        title: 'BEST TIME',
        description: 'In spring, the bite is most active in the morning and evening hours. During these times, the water warms up faster, awakening the fish. Pike, walleye, and perch are particularly active at dawn, while peaceful species such as crucian carp and bream prefer to feed closer to evening. In March-April, it’s better to fish after noon when the sun has warmed the water a bit, and in May, fishing becomes productive all day long.'

        title: 'BEST SPOTS',
        description: 'In spring, promising spots are warm bays, shallow areas, and river mouths. Peaceful fish prefer to stay near the shore where young vegetation appears. Predators like pike hide in the reeds or snags. In large bodies of water, it’s best to look for fish near the mouths of small rivers, where the water is rich in oxygen.'

        title: 'GEAR AND BAIT',
        description: 'In spring, it’s important to choose tackle depending on the type of fish. Float rods and feeders are effective for catching roach, bream, and crucian carp. Bait used includes maggots, worms, and corn. For predators, spinning gear with lures and spinners are used. Groundbait should be light and not too aromatic, as cold water slows down fish digestion.'

        title: 'SEA FISHING',
        description: 'In spring, sea fishing also becomes productive. In coastal waters, schools of herring, mullet, and sea bass appear. Fish move closer to the shore in search of food, so they can be caught directly from piers or boats. The best times are early morning and sunset. Bait includes chopped fish, shrimp, and marine worms.'

On cloudy days or after rain, you can expect good bites throughout the day. Some species, like catfish or tench, are especially active at night, making night fishing a popular summer activity.'

        title: 'BEST SPOTS',
        description: 'In summer, fish prefer cool water areas – in deep pools, under overhanging trees, near underwater springs, or in shaded backwaters. In larger bodies of water, predators (pike, walleye) go deeper, while carp species may be found near weeds and water lilies. In rivers, promising spots include riffles and cliffs, where there is current and oxygen-rich water.'

        title: 'GEAR AND BAIT',
        description: 'In hot months, fish are less active, so it’s worth using lighter and less visible tackle. Feeder setups with long hooks help catch cautious bream and carp. For predators, surface lures like poppers and wobblers are effective. Groundbait should include aromatic components (vanilla, anise, garlic) to attract fish from longer distances.'

        description: 'In summer, sea fishing reaches its peak. In coastal areas, mackerel, horse mackerel, and sea bass are active. Using spinners, jig lures, and live bait provides good results. You can fish from both the shore and a boat. In hot weather, fish move deeper, so it’s best to use heavier tackle and locate schools with a sonar.'

Great places to fish include deep pools, riverbed ledges, and areas with submerged logs and rocks. Carp and bream in autumn prefer the silty bottom, in the bays and backwaters of rivers.'

        title: 'GEAR AND BAIT',
        description: 'In autumn, fish actively feed but require a more “serious” approach. Carp species respond well to animal-based baits – worms, maggots, and bloodworms. For predators, larger lures are effective: vibrotails, spoons, and deep-diving crankbaits. The groundbait should be nutritious but not excessive – mixtures with corn, peas, and chopped worms work well.'

        description: 'In autumn, the season for large sea fish begins. Tuna, cod, flounder, and mackerel actively feed in coastal waters. Bottom fishing, jig lures, and baits such as shrimp or squid work well. Waves can be stronger, so it’s better to go boat fishing on calm days or find spots sheltered from the wind.'
